# Inference for Stan model: logistic1_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (52, 50, 51, 50) seconds, 3.4 minutes total
# Sampling took (46, 42, 40, 43) seconds, 2.8 minutes total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
