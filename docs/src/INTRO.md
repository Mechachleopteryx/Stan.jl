# Stan.jl: A Julia interface to CmdStan

Stan is a system for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction. It is extensively used in social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and business. The Stan program language and interfaces are documented [here](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/).

[CmdStan](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/cmdstan.html) is the shell/command line interface to run Stan language programs. 

[Stan.jl](https://github.com/goedman/Stan.jl) wraps CmdStan and captures the samples for further processing.
