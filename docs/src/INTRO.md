# Introduction

## Stan.jl: A Julia interface to CmdStan

The process to perform inference and posterior analysis as specified by the Stan program is well documented [here](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/).

[CmdStan](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/cmdstan.html) is the shell/command line interface to run Stan language programs. Stan.jl wraps CmdStan and captures the samples for further processing.
